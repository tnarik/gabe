# Gabe (Git, All Backed, Easily)

Gabe is a very simple tool, implemented in Python, which takes care of creating clones or mirrors depending on the configuration, from several GIT sources into several GIT targets, as a form of backup.

the MVP takes GitHub as a source and both Gitea and Local folders as sources.
